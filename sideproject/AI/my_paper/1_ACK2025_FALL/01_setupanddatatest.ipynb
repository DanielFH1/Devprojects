      "Washington D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from the Super Bowl champions ceremony at the White House on Tuesday, citing a disagreement over standing for the national anthem. However, none of the Eagles' players took a knee during the 2017 season.  In response to the disinvitation, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement criticizing Trump's decision, labeling him a \"fragile egomaniac.\" Fewer than 10 Eagles players were reportedly committed to attending the White House event, making the decision to disinvite the team a largely symbolic one.  Instead of welcoming the Super Bowl champions to the White House, the President held a \"Celebration of America\" event. The event featured military bands and a group singing of \"God Bless America.\" Trump reiterated his strong support for the country, the flag, and the national anthem throughout the speech, emphasizing their importance to American culture.  Despite the President's call for unity and patriotism, some jeers could be heard in the crowd during the ceremony. It was unclear who the jeers were directed towards, but tensions between the President and NFL players over the national anthem have been high in recent months.  Trump's disinvitation of the Philadelphia Eagles marks the latest chapter in a controversy that began last season when several NFL players took a knee during the national anthem to protest social injustice. The President has been a vocal critic of the practice, often using the issue to rally his base.  The Eagles, who won the Super Bowl in February, released a statement expressing their disappointment over the lack of communication between the team and the White House. \"We are disappointed by the recent decisions of the President and his staff,\" the statement read.\n",

      "Pope Francis Breaks Maskless Tradition as Catholic Countries Take Coronavirus Precautions  Pope Francis started Lent with a traditional Ash Wednesday mass at the Vatican, but with an unexpected twist. In contrast to other Catholic countries taking precautions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Pope chose not to wear a face mask during the ceremony.  A large procession was held at the Santa Sabina basilica in Rome, with Francis urging the faithful to put down their cellphones during Lent and pick up the Bible instead. This year's Ash Wednesday mass carried an even more significant meaning as Lent begins the 40-day period leading up to Easter.  However, things looked quite different in the Philippines, where priests sprinkled ashes on the heads of the faithful instead of making the traditional cross sign to prevent physical contact. Some Catholic countries, such as Italy and the Philippines, have taken measures like avoiding handshakes and kissing the Pope's ring to minimize the risk of infection.  Bishops around the world have suggested other precautions as well. In the Philippines, bishops have recommended refraining from kissing or touching the cross on Good Friday, and in the United States, they have suggested receiving the Eucharistic host by hand instead of the mouth to prevent the spread of the virus. Worshippers are also being advised against holding hands in prayer during masses.  During an Ash Wednesday service at St. Joseph Cathedral in the United States, Catholics filled the pews, and priests carried on the tradition of placing ashes on parishioners' foreheads. Some worshippers expressed little concern about the virus, but others noted a reluctance to shake hands during mass recently.  \"This is a time for us to be cautious but also not to be afraid. We have faith,\" said Maria Martinez, attending the Ash Wednesday service at St.\n",

      "Senator Jim Molan, a conservative politician, is bracing himself for a tough battle in the upcoming Senate election, as he faces challenges from two moderate candidates backed by the Liberal Party's moderate faction.  Richard Shields and Kent Johns, both moderate politicians, are reportedly considering running for the Senate position created by Arthur Sinodinos' appointment as the next ambassador to the United States.  Shields, a former candidate to replace Malcolm Turnbull in Wentworth and once aligned with the hard right faction, has shifted his stance towards the moderates. He came in second place during the contest and has strong support among delegates.  Johns, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to win preselection for the federal seat of Hughes, is also considering throwing his hat in the ring for the Senate position.  In a significant shift in support, neither Prime Minister Scott Morrison nor Turnbull intervened to support Kelly, the sitting MP, in this election. This marks a clear move towards the moderates, which could affect Molan's chances of securing factional support among the 800 delegates.  Molan, who has angered conservatives by urging people to vote below the line in past elections, may face reduced support as a result. Furthermore, the complicated method used to select Senate candidates could complicate matters. The system does not allow for two moderate candidates to be allocated winnable positions, meaning the new senator may only be given a two-year term.  The NSW state executive is anticipated to finalize a timetable for the Senate vote in late November or December. The upcoming election will be closely watched, as the outcome could significantly impact the balance of power in the Senate and potentially lead to a rift within the Liberal Party.\n",

      "The Australian Liberal Party (ALP) leadership crisis deepened this week as ongoing developments unfolded at Parliament House in Canberra. With tension running high among party members, Liberal MP Ben Morton has emerged as a potential kingmaker, indicating he may be the last signature needed on a petition for a party room meeting to address the issue.  Morton, a West Australian representative, expressed his support for Treasurer Scott Morrison to unite the party and become prime minister. \"Scott Morrison is the best person to lead our party and our country at this time,\" Morton stated in a press conference on Tuesday. He added that Morrison's ability to bring unity and stability to the ALP was essential for the good of the party and the nation.  Meanwhile, Turnbull loyalist Christopher Pyne defended Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and criticized some colleagues for prioritizing self-interest over the greater good. \"Our focus should be on the future of the Liberal Party and the Australian people, not personal ambitions,\" Pyne asserted in an interview.  Peter Dutton, a contender for the leadership, has received advice from the former solicitor general, David Bennett, confirming he is not disqualified from parliament due to his childcare business interests. This revelation came as a relief to Dutton, who had been under pressure to prove his eligibility for parliament.  Additionally, Julie Bishop's partner, David Panton, made a bold prediction that Bishop will be prime minister by tomorrow. \"Julie's got the experience, the skills, and the support needed to lead our party,\" Panton told reporters, adding that his partner was well-equipped to handle the demands of the prime ministership.  Despite the ongoing political maneuvering, there have been allegations of intimidation and coercion among MPs. Queensland MP Scott Buchholz spoke out against these tactics, calling on the prime minister to bring on the party room meeting without a list of signatures.\n",

      "A major and deeply disturbing investigation conducted by French authorities has estimated that a staggering 216,000 children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy over the past 70 years. The findings, which have accused the church of exhibiting \"deep, total and even cruel indifference\" towards victims, have left the public in a state of shock and demanded accountability from the religious institution.  The report, which was commissioned to shed light on past abuses and restore public confidence in the Catholic Church, identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony. Most of the victims were young boys, aged between 10 and 13. Unfortunately, this latest scandal comes after a series of similar sexual abuse cases involving children around the world, underlining the need for immediate and decisive action from the church.  The scale of the abuse, most prevalent in the 1950s to 1970s and experiencing a resurgence in the early 1990s, is unprecedented. The report detailed how the Catholic Church failed to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and to take action to prevent and end the abuse. The French conference of bishops has shown remorse, with its head asking for forgiveness and promising \"concrete actions\" to address the issue.  However, victims and their families have emphasized the importance of recognition and responsibility from the church for the abuse they have suffered. Many have accused the institution of cowardice and betrayal – devastating claims that demand an urgent response.  The commission's findings also recommended several steps to ensure the prevention of future abuse. These include systematically checking criminal records of church personnel and providing priests with adequate training. The church must also ensure that any reports of abuse are immediately transmitted to judicial authorities, rather than being handled internally.\n"
