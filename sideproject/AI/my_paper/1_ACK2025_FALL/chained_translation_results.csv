"Washington D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from the Super Bowl champions ceremony at the White House on Tuesday, citing a disagreement over standing for the national anthem. However, none of the Eagles' players took a knee during the 2017 season.  In response to the disinvitation, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement criticizing Trump's decision, labeling him a ""fragile egomaniac."" Fewer than 10 Eagles players were reportedly committed to attending the White House event, making the decision to disinvite the team a largely symbolic one.  Instead of welcoming the Super Bowl champions to the White House, the President held a ""Celebration of America"" event. The event featured military bands and a group singing of ""God Bless America."" Trump reiterated his strong support for the country, the flag, and the national anthem throughout the speech, emphasizing their importance to American culture.  Despite the President's call for unity and patriotism, some jeers could be heard in the crowd during the ceremony. It was unclear who the jeers were directed towards, but tensions between the President and NFL players over the national anthem have been high in recent months.  Trump's disinvitation of the Philadelphia Eagles marks the latest chapter in a controversy that began last season when several NFL players took a knee during the national anthem to protest social injustice. The President has been a vocal critic of the practice, often using the issue to rally his base.  The Eagles, who won the Super Bowl in February, released a statement expressing their disappointment over the lack of communication between the team and the White House. ""We are disappointed by the recent decisions of the President and his staff,"" the statement read.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Pope Francis Breaks Maskless Tradition as Catholic Countries Take Coronavirus Precautions  Pope Francis started Lent with a traditional Ash Wednesday mass at the Vatican, but with an unexpected twist. In contrast to other Catholic countries taking precautions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Pope chose not to wear a face mask during the ceremony.  A large procession was held at the Santa Sabina basilica in Rome, with Francis urging the faithful to put down their cellphones during Lent and pick up the Bible instead. This year's Ash Wednesday mass carried an even more significant meaning as Lent begins the 40-day period leading up to Easter.  However, things looked quite different in the Philippines, where priests sprinkled ashes on the heads of the faithful instead of making the traditional cross sign to prevent physical contact. Some Catholic countries, such as Italy and the Philippines, have taken measures like avoiding handshakes and kissing the Pope's ring to minimize the risk of infection.  Bishops around the world have suggested other precautions as well. In the Philippines, bishops have recommended refraining from kissing or touching the cross on Good Friday, and in the United States, they have suggested receiving the Eucharistic host by hand instead of the mouth to prevent the spread of the virus. Worshippers are also being advised against holding hands in prayer during masses.  During an Ash Wednesday service at St. Joseph Cathedral in the United States, Catholics filled the pews, and priests carried on the tradition of placing ashes on parishioners' foreheads. Some worshippers expressed little concern about the virus, but others noted a reluctance to shake hands during mass recently.  ""This is a time for us to be cautious but also not to be afraid. We have faith,"" said Maria Martinez, attending the Ash Wednesday service at St.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Senator Jim Molan, a conservative politician, is bracing himself for a tough battle in the upcoming Senate election, as he faces challenges from two moderate candidates backed by the Liberal Party's moderate faction.  Richard Shields and Kent Johns, both moderate politicians, are reportedly considering running for the Senate position created by Arthur Sinodinos' appointment as the next ambassador to the United States.  Shields, a former candidate to replace Malcolm Turnbull in Wentworth and once aligned with the hard right faction, has shifted his stance towards the moderates. He came in second place during the contest and has strong support among delegates.  Johns, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to win preselection for the federal seat of Hughes, is also considering throwing his hat in the ring for the Senate position.  In a significant shift in support, neither Prime Minister Scott Morrison nor Turnbull intervened to support Kelly, the sitting MP, in this election. This marks a clear move towards the moderates, which could affect Molan's chances of securing factional support among the 800 delegates.  Molan, who has angered conservatives by urging people to vote below the line in past elections, may face reduced support as a result. Furthermore, the complicated method used to select Senate candidates could complicate matters. The system does not allow for two moderate candidates to be allocated winnable positions, meaning the new senator may only be given a two-year term.  The NSW state executive is anticipated to finalize a timetable for the Senate vote in late November or December. The upcoming election will be closely watched, as the outcome could significantly impact the balance of power in the Senate and potentially lead to a rift within the Liberal Party.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"The Australian Liberal Party (ALP) leadership crisis deepened this week as ongoing developments unfolded at Parliament House in Canberra. With tension running high among party members, Liberal MP Ben Morton has emerged as a potential kingmaker, indicating he may be the last signature needed on a petition for a party room meeting to address the issue.  Morton, a West Australian representative, expressed his support for Treasurer Scott Morrison to unite the party and become prime minister. ""Scott Morrison is the best person to lead our party and our country at this time,"" Morton stated in a press conference on Tuesday. He added that Morrison's ability to bring unity and stability to the ALP was essential for the good of the party and the nation.  Meanwhile, Turnbull loyalist Christopher Pyne defended Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and criticized some colleagues for prioritizing self-interest over the greater good. ""Our focus should be on the future of the Liberal Party and the Australian people, not personal ambitions,"" Pyne asserted in an interview.  Peter Dutton, a contender for the leadership, has received advice from the former solicitor general, David Bennett, confirming he is not disqualified from parliament due to his childcare business interests. This revelation came as a relief to Dutton, who had been under pressure to prove his eligibility for parliament.  Additionally, Julie Bishop's partner, David Panton, made a bold prediction that Bishop will be prime minister by tomorrow. ""Julie's got the experience, the skills, and the support needed to lead our party,"" Panton told reporters, adding that his partner was well-equipped to handle the demands of the prime ministership.  Despite the ongoing political maneuvering, there have been allegations of intimidation and coercion among MPs. Queensland MP Scott Buchholz spoke out against these tactics, calling on the prime minister to bring on the party room meeting without a list of signatures.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"A major and deeply disturbing investigation conducted by French authorities has estimated that a staggering 216,000 children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy over the past 70 years. The findings, which have accused the church of exhibiting ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims, have left the public in a state of shock and demanded accountability from the religious institution.  The report, which was commissioned to shed light on past abuses and restore public confidence in the Catholic Church, identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony. Most of the victims were young boys, aged between 10 and 13. Unfortunately, this latest scandal comes after a series of similar sexual abuse cases involving children around the world, underlining the need for immediate and decisive action from the church.  The scale of the abuse, most prevalent in the 1950s to 1970s and experiencing a resurgence in the early 1990s, is unprecedented. The report detailed how the Catholic Church failed to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and to take action to prevent and end the abuse. The French conference of bishops has shown remorse, with its head asking for forgiveness and promising ""concrete actions"" to address the issue.  However, victims and their families have emphasized the importance of recognition and responsibility from the church for the abuse they have suffered. Many have accused the institution of cowardice and betrayal – devastating claims that demand an urgent response.  The commission's findings also recommended several steps to ensure the prevention of future abuse. These include systematically checking criminal records of church personnel and providing priests with adequate training. The church must also ensure that any reports of abuse are immediately transmitted to judicial authorities, rather than being handled internally.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"The Francis Howell School District, located in St. Charles County, Missouri, and serving around 17,000 students, mostly white, has reversed its stance on an anti-racism resolution passed in August 2020, pledging to address racial discrimination following the killing of George Floyd and pressures from about 2,000 protesters. This move comes after the recent elections, which led to a conservative majority on the school board.  The newly-elected board members, backed by the Francis Howell Families political action committee (PAC), argued that phrases like ""systemic racism"" in the original resolution lacked clear definitions and served no purpose. With only two original board members remaining, five new conservative members were elected in April 2022 and 2023. The PAC described the anti-racism resolution as ""woke activism,"" and instead, drafted an alternative resolution opposing all acts of racial discrimination while opposing critical race theory.  Randy Cook, the school board vice president who was elected in 2022 and sponsored the resolution revocation, stated that the school board should focus on educating students rather than engaging in national politics. Cook emphasized that many school districts are grappling with controversial debates surrounding critical race theory and are potentially wasting resources, exacerbating divisions, and shaming white children by implementing initiatives perceived as critical race theory in disguise.  In line with this stance, the Ohio State Board of Education rescinded an anti-racism and equity resolution in 2021 and replaced it with a statement promoting academic excellence regardless of race, ethnicity, or creed.  However, racial issues continue to be a sensitive matter in the St. Louis region, given the police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Months of protests ensued, making the issue a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Lake Oswego High School in Oregon is facing a Title IX lawsuit filed by the girls' softball team, alleging discrimination against female athletes due to unequal facilities compared to their male counterparts in the baseball team. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the ten softball players, accuses the Lake Oswego School District of denying the girls equal access to educational opportunities and facilities.  According to the complaint, the softball team's dugout is surrounded by dirt and drainage issues, while the baseball team enjoys pristine facilities. The girls' hitting facility has yet to be constructed despite a substantial donation, while the baseball team already has a proper hitting facility. Instead, the softball team practices in the rain behind a set of bleachers, while the baseball team practices on an on-campus artificial turf field.  Attorney Andrew Glascock of the Glascock Law Firm, who represents the softball team, stated during a press conference that each girl signed onto the lawsuit, seeking ""injunctive relief"" and asking the school district to immediately address the discriminatory conduct. Glascock clarified that the girls are not looking for monetary damages but rather for the school district to provide them with equal opportunities to participate in interscholastic athletics, including equal access to facilities.  The complaint further highlights concerns regarding the safety of the softball team's practicing area. During inclement weather, the girls must practice inside a gymnasium using an old net, which can cause injuries. In stark contrast, the baseball team's field comes equipped with a press box, sound system, clean bathrooms, and even a United States flag for the pre-game anthem.  Glascock stressed that Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities, including athletics. He added that the school district is obligated to provide girls with equal opportunities to participate in sports and to ensure that girls' athletic programs receive the same benefits and opportunities as boys' programs.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Raila Odinga, the opposition leader in Kenya, declared on Tuesday that he would contest the results of the presidential election with all constitutional and legal means possible, after Deputy President William Ruto was announced as the winner. Ruto secured approximately 50.5% of the votes, but the election outcome has been met with claims of irregularities and fraud from Odinga and his supporters.  In a statement, Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenyan politics for over 25 years, described the results as ""null and void."" He demanded that the decisions of the electoral commission be made by consensus, rather than the controversial math used by the commission chairman that gave Ruto more than 100.01% of the votes. The commission's four out of seven members, who did not support the results, claimed that the excess votes could have significantly impacted the election's outcome.  The electoral commission has yet to issue a response to the allegations, and members of Odinga's campaign claimed that the chairman of the commission withheld the election results from the rest of the commission until he declared Ruto the winner. Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, had earlier supported Odinga instead of his own deputy, Ruto, shocking many Kenyans. Some speculate that Kenyatta played a role in appointing the dissenting commissioners last year as part of a strategy to ensure a favourable election outcome.  Ruto, on the other hand, campaigned on economic differences rather than the ethnic divisions that have long marked Kenya's politics. However, the turnout for the election was surprisingly low, with only 65% of the 56 million registered voters casting their ballots. Ruto's own past includes an indictment by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity over his role in the 2007 election violence.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Yerevan, Armenia - In a surprising turn of events, the ruling Armenian Republican Party has announced its support for Nikol Pashinyan to become the country's next prime minister. Pashinyan, the only opposition candidate, had previously been rejected by parliament during a vote in April.  The Republican Party’s decision comes after mass protests led by Pashinyan and his supporters, which have brought the streets of Yerevan to a standstill. Tens of thousands of people have been blocking roads and government buildings, demonstrating against the ruling elite and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who has been in power since 2014.  Sargsyan, a former president who had assumed the prime minister role after constitutional amendments in 2015, faced widespread criticism for trying to extend his tenure and consolidate power. His tenure was marked by economic stagnation, high unemployment, and a decline in living standards, forcing many Armenians to take to the streets in protest.  Pashinyan, a former journalist, has spent the last two years in jail following the disputed elections in 2008, during which he had been a key figure in organizing protests against election fraud. His supporters argue that the ruling elite has lost popular support and should step aside, paving the way for new leadership. However, others see Pashinyan as a demagogue trying to overthrow democratically-elected leaders.  The Republican Party’s endorsement of Pashinyan was a significant turn for the party, which had previously rejected his bid to become prime minister. The development marks the first time a major political force has publicly embraced Pashinyan's cause, increasing the likelihood of his election as prime minister in the upcoming parliamentary vote scheduled for May 8.  The decision to endorse Pashinyan represents a significant shift in political dynamics in Armenia.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"On January 14, 2011, Tunisia was catapulted into a new chapter in its history as widespread protests engulfed the nation, leading to the departure of President Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali and his flight to Saudi Arabia. The protests, triggered by unemployment and rising food prices, took the Arab world by storm and quickly spread across social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  The protests, which began in the impoverished regions of the country, saw Tunisians take to the streets in their thousands to demand political reform and an end to corruption. Supporters of the movement to oust the president celebrated in the capital Tunis and other major cities, as Mohammed Ghannouchi, the prime minister, claimed control of the country.  Arab leaders closely watched the developments in Tunisia, with similar protests breaking out in Jordan and North Africa. Protesters outside the Tunisian embassy in Cairo celebrated the fall of Ben Ali and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down in solidarity. The use of social media was described as a significant factor in the protests, allowing protesters to coordinate and spread information to the world in real-time.  ""Social media played a significant role in organizing protests and spreading information,"" said one Tunisian activist. ""It is a powerful tool for mobilizing people, and it has united Tunisians and people across the Arab world.""  The situation in Tunisia quickly degenerated into violent confrontations between protesters and police. Reports of shootings and fatalities began to emerge, adding to the chaos and uncertainty. Protesters accused the police of using excessive force to quell the demonstrations, and footage of violent confrontations circulated on the internet, fuelling international condemnation.  The United States condemned the use of violence against citizens and expressed its support for the Tunisian people's struggle for universal rights.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"A major and deeply disturbing investigation conducted by French authorities has estimated that a staggering 216,000 children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy over the past 70 years. The findings, which have accused the church of exhibiting ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims, have left the public in a state of shock and demanded accountability from the religious institution.  The report, which was commissioned to shed light on past abuses and restore public confidence in the Catholic Church, identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony. Most of the victims were young boys, aged between 10 and 13. Unfortunately, this latest scandal comes after a series of similar sexual abuse cases involving children around the world, underlining the need for immediate and decisive action from the church.  The scale of the abuse, most prevalent in the 1950s to 1970s and experiencing a resurgence in the early 1990s, is unprecedented. The report detailed how the Catholic Church failed to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and to take action to prevent and end the abuse. The French conference of bishops has shown remorse, with its head asking for forgiveness and promising ""concrete actions"" to address the issue.  However, victims and their families have emphasized the importance of recognition and responsibility from the church for the abuse they have suffered. Many have accused the institution of cowardice and betrayal – devastating claims that demand an urgent response.  The commission's findings also recommended several steps to ensure the prevention of future abuse. These include systematically checking criminal records of church personnel and providing priests with adequate training. The church must also ensure that any reports of abuse are immediately transmitted to judicial authorities, rather than being handled internally.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"The Francis Howell School District, located in St. Charles County, Missouri, and serving around 17,000 students, mostly white, has reversed its stance on an anti-racism resolution passed in August 2020, pledging to address racial discrimination following the killing of George Floyd and pressures from about 2,000 protesters. This move comes after the recent elections, which led to a conservative majority on the school board.  The newly-elected board members, backed by the Francis Howell Families political action committee (PAC), argued that phrases like ""systemic racism"" in the original resolution lacked clear definitions and served no purpose. With only two original board members remaining, five new conservative members were elected in April 2022 and 2023. The PAC described the anti-racism resolution as ""woke activism,"" and instead, drafted an alternative resolution opposing all acts of racial discrimination while opposing critical race theory.  Randy Cook, the school board vice president who was elected in 2022 and sponsored the resolution revocation, stated that the school board should focus on educating students rather than engaging in national politics. Cook emphasized that many school districts are grappling with controversial debates surrounding critical race theory and are potentially wasting resources, exacerbating divisions, and shaming white children by implementing initiatives perceived as critical race theory in disguise.  In line with this stance, the Ohio State Board of Education rescinded an anti-racism and equity resolution in 2021 and replaced it with a statement promoting academic excellence regardless of race, ethnicity, or creed.  However, racial issues continue to be a sensitive matter in the St. Louis region, given the police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Months of protests ensued, making the issue a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Lake Oswego High School in Oregon is facing a Title IX lawsuit filed by the girls' softball team, alleging discrimination against female athletes due to unequal facilities compared to their male counterparts in the baseball team. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the ten softball players, accuses the Lake Oswego School District of denying the girls equal access to educational opportunities and facilities.  According to the complaint, the softball team's dugout is surrounded by dirt and drainage issues, while the baseball team enjoys pristine facilities. The girls' hitting facility has yet to be constructed despite a substantial donation, while the baseball team already has a proper hitting facility. Instead, the softball team practices in the rain behind a set of bleachers, while the baseball team practices on an on-campus artificial turf field.  Attorney Andrew Glascock of the Glascock Law Firm, who represents the softball team, stated during a press conference that each girl signed onto the lawsuit, seeking ""injunctive relief"" and asking the school district to immediately address the discriminatory conduct. Glascock clarified that the girls are not looking for monetary damages but rather for the school district to provide them with equal opportunities to participate in interscholastic athletics, including equal access to facilities.  The complaint further highlights concerns regarding the safety of the softball team's practicing area. During inclement weather, the girls must practice inside a gymnasium using an old net, which can cause injuries. In stark contrast, the baseball team's field comes equipped with a press box, sound system, clean bathrooms, and even a United States flag for the pre-game anthem.  Glascock stressed that Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities, including athletics. He added that the school district is obligated to provide girls with equal opportunities to participate in sports and to ensure that girls' athletic programs receive the same benefits and opportunities as boys' programs.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Raila Odinga, the opposition leader in Kenya, declared on Tuesday that he would contest the results of the presidential election with all constitutional and legal means possible, after Deputy President William Ruto was announced as the winner. Ruto secured approximately 50.5% of the votes, but the election outcome has been met with claims of irregularities and fraud from Odinga and his supporters.  In a statement, Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenyan politics for over 25 years, described the results as ""null and void."" He demanded that the decisions of the electoral commission be made by consensus, rather than the controversial math used by the commission chairman that gave Ruto more than 100.01% of the votes. The commission's four out of seven members, who did not support the results, claimed that the excess votes could have significantly impacted the election's outcome.  The electoral commission has yet to issue a response to the allegations, and members of Odinga's campaign claimed that the chairman of the commission withheld the election results from the rest of the commission until he declared Ruto the winner. Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, had earlier supported Odinga instead of his own deputy, Ruto, shocking many Kenyans. Some speculate that Kenyatta played a role in appointing the dissenting commissioners last year as part of a strategy to ensure a favourable election outcome.  Ruto, on the other hand, campaigned on economic differences rather than the ethnic divisions that have long marked Kenya's politics. However, the turnout for the election was surprisingly low, with only 65% of the 56 million registered voters casting their ballots. Ruto's own past includes an indictment by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity over his role in the 2007 election violence.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Yerevan, Armenia - In a surprising turn of events, the ruling Armenian Republican Party has announced its support for Nikol Pashinyan to become the country's next prime minister. Pashinyan, the only opposition candidate, had previously been rejected by parliament during a vote in April.  The Republican Party’s decision comes after mass protests led by Pashinyan and his supporters, which have brought the streets of Yerevan to a standstill. Tens of thousands of people have been blocking roads and government buildings, demonstrating against the ruling elite and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who has been in power since 2014.  Sargsyan, a former president who had assumed the prime minister role after constitutional amendments in 2015, faced widespread criticism for trying to extend his tenure and consolidate power. His tenure was marked by economic stagnation, high unemployment, and a decline in living standards, forcing many Armenians to take to the streets in protest.  Pashinyan, a former journalist, has spent the last two years in jail following the disputed elections in 2008, during which he had been a key figure in organizing protests against election fraud. His supporters argue that the ruling elite has lost popular support and should step aside, paving the way for new leadership. However, others see Pashinyan as a demagogue trying to overthrow democratically-elected leaders.  The Republican Party’s endorsement of Pashinyan was a significant turn for the party, which had previously rejected his bid to become prime minister. The development marks the first time a major political force has publicly embraced Pashinyan's cause, increasing the likelihood of his election as prime minister in the upcoming parliamentary vote scheduled for May 8.  The decision to endorse Pashinyan represents a significant shift in political dynamics in Armenia.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"On January 14, 2011, Tunisia was catapulted into a new chapter in its history as widespread protests engulfed the nation, leading to the departure of President Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali and his flight to Saudi Arabia. The protests, triggered by unemployment and rising food prices, took the Arab world by storm and quickly spread across social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  The protests, which began in the impoverished regions of the country, saw Tunisians take to the streets in their thousands to demand political reform and an end to corruption. Supporters of the movement to oust the president celebrated in the capital Tunis and other major cities, as Mohammed Ghannouchi, the prime minister, claimed control of the country.  Arab leaders closely watched the developments in Tunisia, with similar protests breaking out in Jordan and North Africa. Protesters outside the Tunisian embassy in Cairo celebrated the fall of Ben Ali and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down in solidarity. The use of social media was described as a significant factor in the protests, allowing protesters to coordinate and spread information to the world in real-time.  ""Social media played a significant role in organizing protests and spreading information,"" said one Tunisian activist. ""It is a powerful tool for mobilizing people, and it has united Tunisians and people across the Arab world.""  The situation in Tunisia quickly degenerated into violent confrontations between protesters and police. Reports of shootings and fatalities began to emerge, adding to the chaos and uncertainty. Protesters accused the police of using excessive force to quell the demonstrations, and footage of violent confrontations circulated on the internet, fuelling international condemnation.  The United States condemned the use of violence against citizens and expressed its support for the Tunisian people's struggle for universal rights.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Washington D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from the Super Bowl champions ceremony at the White House on Tuesday, citing a disagreement over standing for the national anthem. However, none of the Eagles' players took a knee during the 2017 season.  In response to the disinvitation, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement criticizing Trump's decision, labeling him a ""fragile egomaniac."" Fewer than 10 Eagles players were reportedly committed to attending the White House event, making the decision to disinvite the team a largely symbolic one.  Instead of welcoming the Super Bowl champions to the White House, the President held a ""Celebration of America"" event. The event featured military bands and a group singing of ""God Bless America."" Trump reiterated his strong support for the country, the flag, and the national anthem throughout the speech, emphasizing their importance to American culture.  Despite the President's call for unity and patriotism, some jeers could be heard in the crowd during the ceremony. It was unclear who the jeers were directed towards, but tensions between the President and NFL players over the national anthem have been high in recent months.  Trump's disinvitation of the Philadelphia Eagles marks the latest chapter in a controversy that began last season when several NFL players took a knee during the national anthem to protest social injustice. The President has been a vocal critic of the practice, often using the issue to rally his base.  The Eagles, who won the Super Bowl in February, released a statement expressing their disappointment over the lack of communication between the team and the White House. ""We are disappointed by the recent decisions of the President and his staff,"" the statement read.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Pope Francis Breaks Maskless Tradition as Catholic Countries Take Coronavirus Precautions  Pope Francis started Lent with a traditional Ash Wednesday mass at the Vatican, but with an unexpected twist. In contrast to other Catholic countries taking precautions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Pope chose not to wear a face mask during the ceremony.  A large procession was held at the Santa Sabina basilica in Rome, with Francis urging the faithful to put down their cellphones during Lent and pick up the Bible instead. This year's Ash Wednesday mass carried an even more significant meaning as Lent begins the 40-day period leading up to Easter.  However, things looked quite different in the Philippines, where priests sprinkled ashes on the heads of the faithful instead of making the traditional cross sign to prevent physical contact. Some Catholic countries, such as Italy and the Philippines, have taken measures like avoiding handshakes and kissing the Pope's ring to minimize the risk of infection.  Bishops around the world have suggested other precautions as well. In the Philippines, bishops have recommended refraining from kissing or touching the cross on Good Friday, and in the United States, they have suggested receiving the Eucharistic host by hand instead of the mouth to prevent the spread of the virus. Worshippers are also being advised against holding hands in prayer during masses.  During an Ash Wednesday service at St. Joseph Cathedral in the United States, Catholics filled the pews, and priests carried on the tradition of placing ashes on parishioners' foreheads. Some worshippers expressed little concern about the virus, but others noted a reluctance to shake hands during mass recently.  ""This is a time for us to be cautious but also not to be afraid. We have faith,"" said Maria Martinez, attending the Ash Wednesday service at St.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Senator Jim Molan, a conservative politician, is bracing himself for a tough battle in the upcoming Senate election, as he faces challenges from two moderate candidates backed by the Liberal Party's moderate faction.  Richard Shields and Kent Johns, both moderate politicians, are reportedly considering running for the Senate position created by Arthur Sinodinos' appointment as the next ambassador to the United States.  Shields, a former candidate to replace Malcolm Turnbull in Wentworth and once aligned with the hard right faction, has shifted his stance towards the moderates. He came in second place during the contest and has strong support among delegates.  Johns, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to win preselection for the federal seat of Hughes, is also considering throwing his hat in the ring for the Senate position.  In a significant shift in support, neither Prime Minister Scott Morrison nor Turnbull intervened to support Kelly, the sitting MP, in this election. This marks a clear move towards the moderates, which could affect Molan's chances of securing factional support among the 800 delegates.  Molan, who has angered conservatives by urging people to vote below the line in past elections, may face reduced support as a result. Furthermore, the complicated method used to select Senate candidates could complicate matters. The system does not allow for two moderate candidates to be allocated winnable positions, meaning the new senator may only be given a two-year term.

"The Francis Howell School District, located in St. Charles County, Missouri, and serving around 17,000 students, mostly white, has reversed its stance on an anti-racism resolution passed in August 2020, pledging to address racial discrimination following the killing of George Floyd and pressures from about 2,000 protesters. This move comes after the recent elections, which led to a conservative majority on the school board.  The newly-elected board members, backed by the Francis Howell Families political action committee (PAC), argued that phrases like ""systemic racism"" in the original resolution lacked clear definitions and served no purpose. With only two original board members remaining, five new conservative members were elected in April 2022 and 2023. The PAC described the anti-racism resolution as ""woke activism,"" and instead, drafted an alternative resolution opposing all acts of racial discrimination while opposing critical race theory.  Randy Cook, the school board vice president who was elected in 2022 and sponsored the resolution revocation, stated that the school board should focus on educating students rather than engaging in national politics. Cook emphasized that many school districts are grappling with controversial debates surrounding critical race theory and are potentially wasting resources, exacerbating divisions, and shaming white children by implementing initiatives perceived as critical race theory in disguise.  In line with this stance, the Ohio State Board of Education rescinded an anti-racism and equity resolution in 2021 and replaced it with a statement promoting academic excellence regardless of race, ethnicity, or creed.  However, racial issues continue to be a sensitive matter in the St. Louis region, given the police officer's fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Months of protests ensued, making the issue a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Lake Oswego High School in Oregon is facing a Title IX lawsuit filed by the girls' softball team, alleging discrimination against female athletes due to unequal facilities compared to their male counterparts in the baseball team. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the ten softball players, accuses the Lake Oswego School District of denying the girls equal access to educational opportunities and facilities.  According to the complaint, the softball team's dugout is surrounded by dirt and drainage issues, while the baseball team enjoys pristine facilities. The girls' hitting facility has yet to be constructed despite a substantial donation, while the baseball team already has a proper hitting facility. Instead, the softball team practices in the rain behind a set of bleachers, while the baseball team practices on an on-campus artificial turf field.  Attorney Andrew Glascock of the Glascock Law Firm, who represents the softball team, stated during a press conference that each girl signed onto the lawsuit, seeking ""injunctive relief"" and asking the school district to immediately address the discriminatory conduct. Glascock clarified that the girls are not looking for monetary damages but rather for the school district to provide them with equal opportunities to participate in interscholastic athletics, including equal access to facilities.  The complaint further highlights concerns regarding the safety of the softball team's practicing area. During inclement weather, the girls must practice inside a gymnasium using an old net, which can cause injuries. In stark contrast, the baseball team's field comes equipped with a press box, sound system, clean bathrooms, and even a United States flag for the pre-game anthem.  Glascock stressed that Title IX prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities, including athletics. He added that the school district is obligated to provide girls with equal opportunities to participate in sports and to ensure that girls' athletic programs receive the same benefits and opportunities as boys' programs.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Raila Odinga, the opposition leader in Kenya, declared on Tuesday that he would contest the results of the presidential election with all constitutional and legal means possible, after Deputy President William Ruto was announced as the winner. Ruto secured approximately 50.5% of the votes, but the election outcome has been met with claims of irregularities and fraud from Odinga and his supporters.  In a statement, Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenyan politics for over 25 years, described the results as ""null and void."" He demanded that the decisions of the electoral commission be made by consensus, rather than the controversial math used by the commission chairman that gave Ruto more than 100.01% of the votes. The commission's four out of seven members, who did not support the results, claimed that the excess votes could have significantly impacted the election's outcome.  The electoral commission has yet to issue a response to the allegations, and members of Odinga's campaign claimed that the chairman of the commission withheld the election results from the rest of the commission until he declared Ruto the winner. Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, had earlier supported Odinga instead of his own deputy, Ruto, shocking many Kenyans. Some speculate that Kenyatta played a role in appointing the dissenting commissioners last year as part of a strategy to ensure a favourable election outcome.  Ruto, on the other hand, campaigned on economic differences rather than the ethnic divisions that have long marked Kenya's politics. However, the turnout for the election was surprisingly low, with only 65% of the 56 million registered voters casting their ballots. Ruto's own past includes an indictment by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity over his role in the 2007 election violence.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Yerevan, Armenia - In a surprising turn of events, the ruling Armenian Republican Party has announced its support for Nikol Pashinyan to become the country's next prime minister. Pashinyan, the only opposition candidate, had previously been rejected by parliament during a vote in April.  The Republican Party’s decision comes after mass protests led by Pashinyan and his supporters, which have brought the streets of Yerevan to a standstill. Tens of thousands of people have been blocking roads and government buildings, demonstrating against the ruling elite and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who has been in power since 2014.  Sargsyan, a former president who had assumed the prime minister role after constitutional amendments in 2015, faced widespread criticism for trying to extend his tenure and consolidate power. His tenure was marked by economic stagnation, high unemployment, and a decline in living standards, forcing many Armenians to take to the streets in protest.  Pashinyan, a former journalist, has spent the last two years in jail following the disputed elections in 2008, during which he had been a key figure in organizing protests against election fraud. His supporters argue that the ruling elite has lost popular support and should step aside, paving the way for new leadership. However, others see Pashinyan as a demagogue trying to overthrow democratically-elected leaders.  The Republican Party’s endorsement of Pashinyan was a significant turn for the party, which had previously rejected his bid to become prime minister. The development marks the first time a major political force has publicly embraced Pashinyan's cause, increasing the likelihood of his election as prime minister in the upcoming parliamentary vote scheduled for May 8.  The decision to endorse Pashinyan represents a significant shift in political dynamics in Armenia.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"On January 14, 2011, Tunisia was catapulted into a new chapter in its history as widespread protests engulfed the nation, leading to the departure of President Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali and his flight to Saudi Arabia. The protests, triggered by unemployment and rising food prices, took the Arab world by storm and quickly spread across social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  The protests, which began in the impoverished regions of the country, saw Tunisians take to the streets in their thousands to demand political reform and an end to corruption. Supporters of the movement to oust the president celebrated in the capital Tunis and other major cities, as Mohammed Ghannouchi, the prime minister, claimed control of the country.  Arab leaders closely watched the developments in Tunisia, with similar protests breaking out in Jordan and North Africa. Protesters outside the Tunisian embassy in Cairo celebrated the fall of Ben Ali and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down in solidarity. The use of social media was described as a significant factor in the protests, allowing protesters to coordinate and spread information to the world in real-time.  ""Social media played a significant role in organizing protests and spreading information,"" said one Tunisian activist. ""It is a powerful tool for mobilizing people, and it has united Tunisians and people across the Arab world.""  The situation in Tunisia quickly degenerated into violent confrontations between protesters and police. Reports of shootings and fatalities began to emerge, adding to the chaos and uncertainty. Protesters accused the police of using excessive force to quell the demonstrations, and footage of violent confrontations circulated on the internet, fuelling international condemnation.  The United States condemned the use of violence against citizens and expressed its support for the Tunisian people's struggle for universal rights.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Washington D.C. - In a surprising turn of events, President Donald Trump disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles from the Super Bowl champions ceremony at the White House on Tuesday, citing a disagreement over standing for the national anthem. However, none of the Eagles' players took a knee during the 2017 season.  In response to the disinvitation, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement criticizing Trump's decision, labeling him a ""fragile egomaniac."" Fewer than 10 Eagles players were reportedly committed to attending the White House event, making the decision to disinvite the team a largely symbolic one.  Instead of welcoming the Super Bowl champions to the White House, the President held a ""Celebration of America"" event. The event featured military bands and a group singing of ""God Bless America."" Trump reiterated his strong support for the country, the flag, and the national anthem throughout the speech, emphasizing their importance to American culture.  Despite the President's call for unity and patriotism, some jeers could be heard in the crowd during the ceremony. It was unclear who the jeers were directed towards, but tensions between the President and NFL players over the national anthem have been high in recent months.  Trump's disinvitation of the Philadelphia Eagles marks the latest chapter in a controversy that began last season when several NFL players took a knee during the national anthem to protest social injustice. The President has been a vocal critic of the practice, often using the issue to rally his base.  The Eagles, who won the Super Bowl in February, released a statement expressing their disappointment over the lack of communication between the team and the White House. ""We are disappointed by the recent decisions of the President and his staff,"" the statement read.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Pope Francis Breaks Maskless Tradition as Catholic Countries Take Coronavirus Precautions  Pope Francis started Lent with a traditional Ash Wednesday mass at the Vatican, but with an unexpected twist. In contrast to other Catholic countries taking precautions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the Pope chose not to wear a face mask during the ceremony.  A large procession was held at the Santa Sabina basilica in Rome, with Francis urging the faithful to put down their cellphones during Lent and pick up the Bible instead. This year's Ash Wednesday mass carried an even more significant meaning as Lent begins the 40-day period leading up to Easter.  However, things looked quite different in the Philippines, where priests sprinkled ashes on the heads of the faithful instead of making the traditional cross sign to prevent physical contact. Some Catholic countries, such as Italy and the Philippines, have taken measures like avoiding handshakes and kissing the Pope's ring to minimize the risk of infection.  Bishops around the world have suggested other precautions as well. In the Philippines, bishops have recommended refraining from kissing or touching the cross on Good Friday, and in the United States, they have suggested receiving the Eucharistic host by hand instead of the mouth to prevent the spread of the virus. Worshippers are also being advised against holding hands in prayer during masses.  During an Ash Wednesday service at St. Joseph Cathedral in the United States, Catholics filled the pews, and priests carried on the tradition of placing ashes on parishioners' foreheads. Some worshippers expressed little concern about the virus, but others noted a reluctance to shake hands during mass recently.  ""This is a time for us to be cautious but also not to be afraid. We have faith,"" said Maria Martinez, attending the Ash Wednesday service at St.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Senator Jim Molan, a conservative politician, is bracing himself for a tough battle in the upcoming Senate election, as he faces challenges from two moderate candidates backed by the Liberal Party's moderate faction.  Richard Shields and Kent Johns, both moderate politicians, are reportedly considering running for the Senate position created by Arthur Sinodinos' appointment as the next ambassador to the United States.  Shields, a former candidate to replace Malcolm Turnbull in Wentworth and once aligned with the hard right faction, has shifted his stance towards the moderates. He came in second place during the contest and has strong support among delegates.  Johns, who has been unsuccessful in his attempts to win preselection for the federal seat of Hughes, is also considering throwing his hat in the ring for the Senate position.  In a significant shift in support, neither Prime Minister Scott Morrison nor Turnbull intervened to support Kelly, the sitting MP, in this election. This marks a clear move towards the moderates, which could affect Molan's chances of securing factional support among the 800 delegates.  Molan, who has angered conservatives by urging people to vote below the line in past elections, may face reduced support as a result. Furthermore, the complicated method used to select Senate candidates could complicate matters. The system does not allow for two moderate candidates to be allocated winnable positions, meaning the new senator may only be given a two-year term.  The NSW state executive is anticipated to finalize a timetable for the Senate vote in late November or December. The upcoming election will be closely watched, as the outcome could significantly impact the balance of power in the Senate and potentially lead to a rift within the Liberal Party.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"The Australian Liberal Party (ALP) leadership crisis deepened this week as ongoing developments unfolded at Parliament House in Canberra. With tension running high among party members, Liberal MP Ben Morton has emerged as a potential kingmaker, indicating he may be the last signature needed on a petition for a party room meeting to address the issue.  Morton, a West Australian representative, expressed his support for Treasurer Scott Morrison to unite the party and become prime minister. ""Scott Morrison is the best person to lead our party and our country at this time,"" Morton stated in a press conference on Tuesday. He added that Morrison's ability to bring unity and stability to the ALP was essential for the good of the party and the nation.  Meanwhile, Turnbull loyalist Christopher Pyne defended Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and criticized some colleagues for prioritizing self-interest over the greater good. ""Our focus should be on the future of the Liberal Party and the Australian people, not personal ambitions,"" Pyne asserted in an interview.  Peter Dutton, a contender for the leadership, has received advice from the former solicitor general, David Bennett, confirming he is not disqualified from parliament due to his childcare business interests. This revelation came as a relief to Dutton, who had been under pressure to prove his eligibility for parliament.  Additionally, Julie Bishop's partner, David Panton, made a bold prediction that Bishop will be prime minister by tomorrow. ""Julie's got the experience, the skills, and the support needed to lead our party,"" Panton told reporters, adding that his partner was well-equipped to handle the demands of the prime ministership.  Despite the ongoing political maneuvering, there have been allegations of intimidation and coercion among MPs. Queensland MP Scott Buchholz spoke out against these tactics, calling on the prime minister to bring on the party room meeting without a list of signatures.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"A major and deeply disturbing investigation conducted by French authorities has estimated that a staggering 216,000 children were sexually abused by Catholic clergy over the past 70 years. The findings, which have accused the church of exhibiting ""deep, total and even cruel indifference"" towards victims, have left the public in a state of shock and demanded accountability from the religious institution.  The report, which was commissioned to shed light on past abuses and restore public confidence in the Catholic Church, identified around 2,700 victims through a call for testimony. Most of the victims were young boys, aged between 10 and 13. Unfortunately, this latest scandal comes after a series of similar sexual abuse cases involving children around the world, underlining the need for immediate and decisive action from the church.  The scale of the abuse, most prevalent in the 1950s to 1970s and experiencing a resurgence in the early 1990s, is unprecedented. The report detailed how the Catholic Church failed to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and to take action to prevent and end the abuse. The French conference of bishops has shown remorse, with its head asking for forgiveness and promising ""concrete actions"" to address the issue.  However, victims and their families have emphasized the importance of recognition and responsibility from the church for the abuse they have suffered. Many have accused the institution of cowardice and betrayal – devastating claims that demand an urgent response.  The commission's findings also recommended several steps to ensure the prevention of future abuse. These include systematically checking criminal records of church personnel and providing priests with adequate training. The church must also ensure that any reports of abuse are immediately transmitted to judicial authorities, rather than being handled internally.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

In a statement, Odinga, a prominent figure in Kenyan politics for over 25 years, described the results as ""null and void."" He demanded that the decisions of the electoral commission be made by consensus, rather than the controversial math used by the commission chairman that gave Ruto more than 100.01% of the votes. The commission's four out of seven members, who did not support the results, claimed that the excess votes could have significantly impacted the election's outcome.  The electoral commission has yet to issue a response to the allegations, and members of Odinga's campaign claimed that the chairman of the commission withheld the election results from the rest of the commission until he declared Ruto the winner. Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, had earlier supported Odinga instead of his own deputy, Ruto, shocking many Kenyans. Some speculate that Kenyatta played a role in appointing the dissenting commissioners last year as part of a strategy to ensure a favourable election outcome.  Ruto, on the other hand, campaigned on economic differences rather than the ethnic divisions that have long marked Kenya's politics. However, the turnout for the election was surprisingly low, with only 65% of the 56 million registered voters casting their ballots. Ruto's own past includes an indictment by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity over his role in the 2007 election violence.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"Yerevan, Armenia - In a surprising turn of events, the ruling Armenian Republican Party has announced its support for Nikol Pashinyan to become the country's next prime minister. Pashinyan, the only opposition candidate, had previously been rejected by parliament during a vote in April.  The Republican Party’s decision comes after mass protests led by Pashinyan and his supporters, which have brought the streets of Yerevan to a standstill. Tens of thousands of people have been blocking roads and government buildings, demonstrating against the ruling elite and calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan, who has been in power since 2014.  Sargsyan, a former president who had assumed the prime minister role after constitutional amendments in 2015, faced widespread criticism for trying to extend his tenure and consolidate power. His tenure was marked by economic stagnation, high unemployment, and a decline in living standards, forcing many Armenians to take to the streets in protest.  Pashinyan, a former journalist, has spent the last two years in jail following the disputed elections in 2008, during which he had been a key figure in organizing protests against election fraud. His supporters argue that the ruling elite has lost popular support and should step aside, paving the way for new leadership. However, others see Pashinyan as a demagogue trying to overthrow democratically-elected leaders.  The Republican Party’s endorsement of Pashinyan was a significant turn for the party, which had previously rejected his bid to become prime minister. The development marks the first time a major political force has publicly embraced Pashinyan's cause, increasing the likelihood of his election as prime minister in the upcoming parliamentary vote scheduled for May 8.  The decision to endorse Pashinyan represents a significant shift in political dynamics in Armenia.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.

"On January 14, 2011, Tunisia was catapulted into a new chapter in its history as widespread protests engulfed the nation, leading to the departure of President Zine Al Abedine Ben Ali and his flight to Saudi Arabia. The protests, triggered by unemployment and rising food prices, took the Arab world by storm and quickly spread across social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.  The protests, which began in the impoverished regions of the country, saw Tunisians take to the streets in their thousands to demand political reform and an end to corruption. Supporters of the movement to oust the president celebrated in the capital Tunis and other major cities, as Mohammed Ghannouchi, the prime minister, claimed control of the country.  Arab leaders closely watched the developments in Tunisia, with similar protests breaking out in Jordan and North Africa. Protesters outside the Tunisian embassy in Cairo celebrated the fall of Ben Ali and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down in solidarity. The use of social media was described as a significant factor in the protests, allowing protesters to coordinate and spread information to the world in real-time.  ""Social media played a significant role in organizing protests and spreading information,"" said one Tunisian activist. ""It is a powerful tool for mobilizing people, and it has united Tunisians and people across the Arab world.""  The situation in Tunisia quickly degenerated into violent confrontations between protesters and police. Reports of shootings and fatalities began to emerge, adding to the chaos and uncertainty. Protesters accused the police of using excessive force to quell the demonstrations, and footage of violent confrontations circulated on the internet, fuelling international condemnation.  The United States condemned the use of violence against citizens and expressed its support for the Tunisian people's struggle for universal rights.","Error: 403 POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?prettyPrint=false: Your application is authenticating by using local Application Default Credentials.
